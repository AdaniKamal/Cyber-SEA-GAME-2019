# well-known vulnerability 2 (MISC - 100)
In this challenge, we got a hint from the name again. The public exploit should be used to solve the problem. The challenge gives us IP Address and Port as 10.3.204.203:2222. We connect to that specific target using a netcat command, and we got "SSH-2.0-libssh_0.8.1" from the connection. Googling and found CVE-2018-10993 to do a libSSH authentication bypass. Finally, we run an exploit to get the flag.
```
python exploitssh.py 10.3.204.203 -p 2222 -c "cat flag.txt"
```
